Create your own HTTP server

Use the techniques you've learnt so far to create your own HTTP server with Express. Your server should:

Automatically recompile and restart when you make changes --> see "dev" script in package.json file
Have a GET route that sends a JSON response --> see app.ts file
Have an integration test for the GET route --> see server.test.ts file
Use an environment variable to configure the server port --> see .env file
